# Discord link-opener 🔗

This **Chrome** extension allows you to **automatically monitor, open links and notify** from Discord in your browser. Thanks to regular expressions, you can automatically open links from your favorite websites without staying on Discord.

The extension will monitor the provided channel, open the first link that matches the regular expressions and notify you when a link is opened.
